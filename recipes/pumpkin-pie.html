        <h3>A beautiful homemade pumpkin pie</h3>

        <p>Nothing beats a fresh pumpkin pie on a chilly autumn day. So, pick your best pumpkin and put on your baking hat and follow this recipe for an excellent pie.</p>
        <p>This recipe of 8 servings will yield a 9 inch pie. Total length to make: 1 hr</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h2>For the crust:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup shortening</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the filling:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar/li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li> 
        </ul>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. </li>
                Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
            <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. </li>
                Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
            <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. 
                Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
            <li>Make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>To prepare mashed pumpkin:</h1>
        <p>Cut a fresh pie pumpkin in half. Scoop out and discard seeds and stringy portions. Leave skin on and cut pumpkin into chunks. Measure out 1 1/2 pounds for this recipe to yield 2 cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin. If your pumpkin is larger, consider cooking 3 pounds and doubling the pie recipe above to make two pies.<br>

            Place pumpkin chunks in saucepan over medium heat with 1 inch water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove and discard peel. Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill until smooth.</p>
